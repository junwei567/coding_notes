# Javascript Notes

This is the notes I wrote while studying Javascript. The contents are taken mostly from Google, but I compiled them here so I can reference to it whenever I need a refresher.

## Definitions

**First Class Functions**
Everything you can do with other types, you can do with functions.
Using functions like strings or numbers.

**Expression**
A block of code that results in a value
Function expressions are possible in Js because functions are first-class.

**Object**
A collection of name/value pairs

**Object Literal**
Name/value pairs separated by commas and surrounded by curly braces. 
Quick and short way to create Js objects

**Inheritance**
One object gets access to properties and methods of another object

**Primitive**
A type of data that represents a single value.
Like number or string. Not an object

**Abstract (Base) Class**
A type of constructor we never work directly with, but inherit from.
We create new custom objects which inherit from these abstract base class.

**Template Literal**
A way to concatenate strings in Js (ES6)

**Callback**
A function passed to some other function, which we assume will be invoked at some point.

**Error-First Callback**
Callbacks that take an error object as their first parameter.
Null if no error, otherwise will contain an object defining the error. this is a standard so we know in what order to place our parameters for our callbacks.

Node is asynchronous, having more than one process running simultaneously. However, Javascript and V8 is synchronous, only one line of code is executing at a time.

**Protocol**
A set if rules 2 sides agree on to use when communicating.

**API**
Application Programming Interface: set of tools for building a software application

**Endpoint**
One URL in a web API

**Serialise**
Translating an object into a format that can be stored or transferred.

**Routing**
Mapping HTTP requests to content

**Middleware**
Code that sits between two layers of 

**RESTful**
Respresentational State Transfer
The verbs and url for the API means something
